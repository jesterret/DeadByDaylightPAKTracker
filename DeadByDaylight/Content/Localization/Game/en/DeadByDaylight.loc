The last standing structure after the fire that still shows the grandeur of the original architecture. Its two floors and dark basement leave behind nothing of the tale of horrors that took place here. Nothing but memories linger in the abandoned rooms.
The Office is where money changed owners and hands were shook. The heavy duty safe in the floor might have been a dead giveaway to the shady business that took place. Wads of cash were hidden all over the place. Stating that money wasn't an issue, maybe people got executed for enjoyment, rather than wealth.
A run-down log cabin at the edge of the scrap yard and the home of its owner. Weird carvings and etchings in the wall perhaps say more about the owner's state of mind and allude to his disappearance. Reports suggested that prisoners were held in its dark basement before they were taken to the crusher.
The Junkyard is packed with sharp objects. Walking around the area, aware of the bloodbath that took place here, changes the landscape. Blood-covered metal and bits of flesh abound. One does not willingly walk amongst all this evidence of death.
This old garage was once not just a place of death and execution. Automobiles were actually repaired here amongst oil mixed with blood. But as investigators found out about the atrocities that took place, it became forgotten.
For decades, Azarov's Gas Heaven offered the last chance for travellers to rest and fuel up before the long, hard haul through the backcountry. Wiser travellers learned to decline that offer. The phones never worked and people had a peculiar habit of going missing. When the highway came through, bypassing Gas Heaven entirely, business dried up and the gas station was abandoned. No one quite knows how many bodies are stashed out there, or what else is hidden in the ruins of the old rest stop.
Once part of the farm, the Slaughterhouse was still in operation for many years after the breakup of the farmland. Rotting stench and stained floors provide proof of all the deaths that have taken place here... Animal or otherwise.
The Silo is one of the oldest remaining buildings that made up Coldwind farm. The great storm of 2003 brought the ancient structure crashing down. It was weeks later that searchers discovered twelve bodies were buried in the ruins. Their crushed corpses were buried deep in the slurry that oozed out from the base and made identification almost impossible.
Even before the fall of Coldwind Farm, the cornfields were surrounded by tales of ominous myths. Everything from mutilated animals to red corn stalks. Now it's abandoned, but still, someone seems to care for the corn in some way as the stalks still stand tall.
The centerpiece of Coldwind Farm, the Farmhouse stood proudly over the fields of golden corn for decades. After the horrific events of 1972, the building fell into disrepair and eventual ruin. The Farmhouse is now nothing more than a forgotten, former home where holidays were once celebrated.
The old run-down cowshed was one of the first barns the Thompsons built on Coldwind Farm. It was originally intended to house sick animals at a safe distance from the rest of the livestock, but no animal who entered it ever survived. An investigation revealed the building was infested with toxic mold. The Thompsons figured it must be a construction fault or something to do with the dampness of the wood. A new barn was built, and the old cowshed was left to rot in the shadows.
A simple street with houses that witnessed the horrors that took place. A jungle gym where children once learned to climb. Sidewalks where fathers taught their daughters to ride a bike. All gone. Instead it sits in the palm of the Entity, forever held in darkness.
The Pale Rose, an ancient paddle steamer in the middle of the swamp, is held captive by the stagnant mud. It has been here long before the residents began their hunt, a barely visible silhouette from the nearby village. There are signs of inhabitation, particularly in the upper states room where strange, ritualistic markings in dried blood and dirt cover the floor. From the scale of the bloodletting, something horrid has taken place here.
You can still see the tiny entrance that miners used to haul the ore to the surface. Now it is nothing more than a pile of rubble. No one bothered to clear it as they feared whatever might be found inside. Instead it fell into oblivion.
Once used for storing the coal that fueled the Foundry, it now lies abandoned. The roof is split wide open, suggesting some titanic explosion, but the angles don't seem to make sense. So to fathom its destiny is not done easily - even if one would want to.
The woods surrounding the estate might be the only witness to what really happened here. Its trees have a certain deformed character, as if what they saw made them want to run away. There are very few visitors to the woods - even animals seem to avoid it if possible.
The beating heart of the Mine, the Foundry was where the iron ore was directly smelted into vast ingots. The huge vats still bear evidence of the bodies that were incinerated within them - preserved in the metal residue.
